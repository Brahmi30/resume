    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am K. Brahmi, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) at Gitam University. I have developed strong technical skills in C, Python, Java, SQL, and HTML and have experience working with platforms like Visual Studio Code and Streamlit. I actively participated in various hackathons and secured 4th prize in the Women Hackathon organized at my college. Apart from academics, I am deeply involved in cultural activities, being an active member of the Cultural Club at Gitam University, where I participated and volunteered in multiple events, which helped me strengthen my communication and teamwork skills.</p>

        I am also a proud member of the startup "Chitti", an initiative aimed at creating and sharing study notes for the entire college community, which enhanced my skills in collaboration and project management. I am always enthusiastic about learning new things, adapting to new technologies, and working with teams toward achieving common goals. My proactive mindset, strong communication skills, and eagerness to take on new challenges make me confident that I will be a valuable addition to your company. I am passionate about contributing to the growth of the organization while also growing personally and professionally. I am always ready to work hard, learn quickly, and make you proud of your decision to have me on your team.
